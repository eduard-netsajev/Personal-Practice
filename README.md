Personal-Practice
=================

My own repository for my practice in different languages (at the moment already C#, Java, PHP, C++, Python)

Done Projects

1) Battle Ships game C# 

2) BuzzFizz C# solution (with a couple of twists)

3) A console C# programm that draws a resizeable field, and user can freely move pointer in it with commands like C4, F17, H13 etc.

Projects In Development

0) Platformer game where you fight against time-wasting, enemies are Reddit, Facebook and alikes. Points for collecting money, books, etc.

1) A programm for school classes checking, which would allow to see which groups are attendind the same classes as you

2) Android application, choose study group in settings, when opened it shows today's classes, in which auditorium they happen and with who (professor + other groups). Bonus function - own schedule making. Bonus Plus function: ability to write down the homework which can be viewed manually or will be just shown whenever the day for this homework comes.

Future Project Ideas:

>1) One of the projects I use to get my first internship was the following: I made a bot in C# that would grab the subreddit of every new post posted to reddit (checks every 30 seconds). I'd keep a log in MySQL of every subreddit I'd come across, then it would go to each subreddit (in accordance to the subreddit rules) and log the subscriber count. I then created a tag cloud of every subreddit I found (I had 54,000 by the time I ended it) and when you clicked on the subreddit, it brought up a graph showing its growth over time.

>2) Encryption/Decryption tool
