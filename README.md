My own repository for my practice in different languages (at the moment only C#)

Future Project Ideas:

>One of the projects I use to get my first internship was the following: I made a bot in C# that would grab the subreddit of every new post posted to reddit (checks every 30 seconds). I'd keep a log in MySQL of every subreddit I'd come across, then it would go to each subreddit (in accordance to the subreddit rules) and log the subscriber count. I then created a tag cloud of every subreddit I found (I had 54,000 by the time I ended it) and when you clicked on the subreddit, it brought up a graph showing its growth over time.
